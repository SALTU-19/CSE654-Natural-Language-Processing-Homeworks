Hi! I’m Mark. I’m a sport addict. I get up very early at 6 
o’clock every day except Sunday in summer because I have 
swimming lessons at 7.30 am. After lunch at 2 pm, I play 
basketball on Tuesday, Friday and at the weekend and I 
also play tennis three times a week at four o’clock in the 
afternoon on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. I have 
volleyball matches on Friday and Sunday at 8 o’clock in 
the evening. I like skiing, too but this year it’s impossible 
because I'm staying with my grandparents. I meet with 
my friends and have dinner every Saturday at 8 pm. 
On Sunday mornings, I get up at about 10 o’clock in the 
morning and have a big breakfast with my grandparents. 
Then, I go bowling with my friends at 3 pm. It’s really fun.

 Hi Ozan,
 
How are the things in Brussels, Ozan? I have no time nowadays. I'm having my 
final exams so I have to study hard. I have some good news. I am joining  a school 
trip in summer holiday. Guess where! To Antalya, your home town. You know, I was 
looking forward to seeing Antalya. I'm really excited. I will tell you about the details 
of the trip 
 We are going to Ankara by plane at first and we are travelling by two busses to 
Antalya. Our bus leaves at 9 a.m. on 25th June from Ankara. I believe it will be joyful. 
We are going to have our lunch in Afyon. As you know, I don't like meat much but 
I will probably eat ''sucuk''. Afyon is famous for its ''sucuk'' and clotted cream so I'm 
going to eat "ekmek-kadayıf” with clotted cream, too. I guess we'll arrive in Antalya 
at about 6 pm. We are going to stay in a boutique hotel in Belek. I think we'll be tired 
and have a rest in our rooms. On the second day, we are visiting Antalya Museum 
after breakfast. As I'm interested in archaeology, I believe I'll learn many new things 
about the history of this area. We are going to Lara Beach in the afternoon. I like 
swimming and I'm sure I'll swim a lot. Next day, we are going to Aspendos and 
Old Harbour in the afternoon and we'll also go shopping in Old Town if we have 
time. The other day is going to be a free day for everyone. We can do whatever we 
want. I'm not sure but I will try doing water sports. I think the last day will be the 
most tiring day. However, I believe it will be very entertaining. In the morning, we 
are visiting Phaselis Ancient City at first.  After lunch, we are moving to Adrasan. 
I think I'll love the nature. We are also going to see Olympos and Chimera Mount 
before we return back to our hotel. We are going to pack up and leave the hotel next 
morning 
I wish I'd see you there. Write me soon. See U!
