        Survival on a Deserted IslanMy name is Samantha. This is the story 
of my survival. It was June 10, 1988. We 
were sailing in the South Pacific. I was 
sleeping when I heard a thunderous 
storm and a cry ''The ship is going down.'' 
The following day, I opened my eyes on 
a beach. I was on an island. There was 
nobody. I had little water and food with 
me but I didn’t lose my hope. I believed 
that they were going to find me. June 12, I found a cave to shelter. I began to write the 
dates on the wall in order not to forget the time. I decided to explore the island because 
I needed water and food. June 13, I saw some small animals inside the island. I followed 
them and found a river. I was happy to find fresh water. June 15, I tried to fish as I was 
just eating bananas and coconuts. June 16, the matches dried so I could make a fire. I 
didn’t give up. I was still trying to catch a fish. After three days, I caught my first fish. 
I cooked and ate. It was really delicious. June 20, I saw a ship passing by the island for 
the first time. They didn't see me. I picked up branches to be able to make a big fire 
for the next time. They could see me by this way. June 22, I got used to life on island 
for the most part. June 25, I felt desperate when I realized I’d lost a significant amount 
of weight but I knew that I had to be hopeful. Fish and fruit wasn’t enough. I caught a 
rabbit to eat. June 30, I was losing my hope but I knew that I had to survive. I wouldn’t 
give up. August 5, I saw two helicopters. I made the fire bigger. They were flying over 
the island. August 11, a rescue boat landed the island. They were looking for the lost 
passengers of the ship.  First aid crew checked me up. August 15, I came to my safe 
home after living on a deserted island for a month1. ______

devices and I can't adopt many of them. 
   When I was a child, it was very difficult to communicate. We used to send telegrams 
and it used to be very difficult to make phone calls. I see that people use their mobile 
phones to send messages and make phone calls easily now. It also used to take so much 
time to go to another  place. We used to travel by carriages, on horses or by train. 
However, there are fast cars, trains and planes now. People can go everywhere easily. 
 When I was young, it was our fun to listen to music. Especially after dinner, we 
used to listen to the records. I still remember  the sound of the record. It was really 
wonderful. Nowadays, my grandchildren listen to music through earphones playing 
on media players. Also, there didn't use to be televisions or game consoles at homes 
so we used to play games like 'beş taş', 'çelik çomak', 'yüzük' or 'kemik'. Today children 
play computer games and they don't know those games. In those days, there used to be 
travelling theatres and I used to look forward to them to come to our village. I used to 
watch Karagöz and Hacivat with my friends and we used to laugh a lot. Everybody sits 
at home and watches television now. Those days were the good days12. Put a cross into the chart according to the text above. (Yukarıdaki metne göre tabloya

''Living today is more comfortable and easier than living in the past.'' 
COMMUNICATION 
EDUCATIOTRANSPORTATION 
HOUSEHOLD TECHNOLOG1. Life today is much more comfortable and easier than it was in our grandparents’ youth 
for some reasons. Technology has made modern-day life much more comfortable than 
in the past. In the past, the conditions of living were not as comfortable as they are now. 
There were no bathrooms and running water in many houses, besides many people 
didn't use to have household appliances like fridge, TV set or vacuum cleaner because 
they used to be luxurious goods.  All the work was done without any modern tool, so 
they had to do the errands by themselves2. People also had some difficulties in communicating with each other in the past, but 
developments in technology help us to communicate easily. It used to be really difficult 
to communicate although with phones, but now, we can have the chance of seeing each 
other while talking on the phone. It wasn't easy to get the news on time, whereas it’s 
really easy and fast to get the news now.  
3. Another difference between living now and in the past is the fact that nowadays the 
access to education is much easier. Students can go to many types of schools in the 
neighbourhood.  In the past, there were fewer schools and the quality of the education 
they provided was much poorer. 
4. Moreover, people were not able to travel such long distances in such short period of 
time. The planes were not that popular then because they used to be a very expensive 
means of transport. Nowadays, we have fast and comfortable cars and more people 
also travel by plane. In addition, people used to use compass while travelling but they 
use navigation today. All things considering, it is an obvious conclusion that life is 
definitely much easier now but it is not easy to decide whether it is also better21. Read the essay in activity 20 again and answer the questions. (20.çalışmada yer alan
