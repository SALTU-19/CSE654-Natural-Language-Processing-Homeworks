Sorry, I haven’t written to you so long but I have been very busy. You know I have been 
here in Turkey for two weeks and I have had a great time. Turkish people are very 
friendly and hospitable. The weather is really wonderful, too. 
I flew to İstanbul two weeks ago and stayed there for five days. İstanbul is a great city. 
You can see both European and Asian culture there. I was very busy going sightseeing 
from morning till night but it wasn’t enough. I have been in Fethiye for 10 days. Fethiye 
is a marvellous holiday destination. I have swum in Ölüdeniz. I have walked to Kayaköy 
and I have seen the ruins of Old Town. I have had a jeep safari to Saklıkent and I have 
gone paragliding from Babadağ to Ölüdeniz. I have tasted delicious local food. I have just 
eaten yummy fish at Balıkpazarı. I’m going to fly back home the next day but I’m sure I 
will miss here because it is the most enjoyable holiday I have ever hadNow, I realise why so many English people buy houses and live here. It is like a part of 
heaven. I hope we get the chance to come together next timeSee you soon!
